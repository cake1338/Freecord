## Requirements

- CMake

### Windows

## Ideas

### Treewidget

#### Rows in the TreeWidget

'Category' is anything that you can expand

'Border' a horizontal line

'Voice' Public/Private (Password / ranks)

'Chat' Public/ Private (Password / ranks)

'Files' Public/ Private (Password / ranks) ;Maybe this one could be inside the Chats but on the side or something, replace the framewidget with banner etc, with a file explorer or recent uploaded files
